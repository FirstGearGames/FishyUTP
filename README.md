#### Transport Component

Add the "FishyUTP" transport component to the "NetworkManager" game object. 

### Configure Relay

FishyUTP supports creating and joining Unity Relay allocations to simplify and secure network connectivity. This is an optional feature that can be disable on FishyUTP transport ("Use Relay").

* Add the "FishyUTP Relay Manager" component to the game object that contains the "FishyUTP" and "NetworkManager" component.

The "Join Code" on the "FishyUTP Relay Manager" represents either the join code generated for the host allocation or the join allocation the client will attempt to connect to.
